# How to read and equation
Using the example of the Stefan-Bolzmann equation, $I = \sigma \epsilon T^4$

1. What is the equation talking about?
    * It relates "intensity" (whatever that is) to temperature, "emissivity", and something called the Stefan-Bolzmann constant.
2. Label the variables: $I \rightarrow \textrm{intensity}$, etc.
3. Identify what the variables *mean* (e.g., $I$ is intensity, a measure of the amount energy coming from an object; $\sigma$ is the Stefan-Bolzmann constant, a universal constant)
4. Figure out what the variables do. Here, increases in $\epsilon$, $\sigma$, and $T$ all cause $I$ to increase, but $T$ is by far the most important because it is raised to the fourth power.
5. Work out the units.
    * $I$: *intensity*: How much radiation the it emitting (per unit surface area)?: $\frac{\textrm{W}}{\textrm{m}^2}$ 
    * $\epsilon$: *emissivity*: How good of a blackbody is it? dimensionless 
    * $\sigma$: *the Stefan-Bolzmann constant*: A basic fact of the universe $\frac{\textrm{W}}{\textrm{m}^2\textrm{K}^4}$
    * $T$: *temperature*: How hot is it? $\textrm{K}$
