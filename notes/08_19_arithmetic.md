## How to read an equation

* Identify variables (what do they stand for?)
* Identify function of variables (which ones make the value go up or down? Are there 'special' values of variables like 1 or 0 that make the equation do funny things?)

## Estimation techniques

* Assume a spherical cow - or a cube-shaped cow, 
* The square root of 3 is 2, for a large enough 3

## How to cite sources

* I will often intentionally omit some information from a homework problem.
    * How to do research
        * Reliable sources - context dependent
    * How to cite sources
        * **BEFORE** you do the math, write down the values of constants (that are not given in the equation)

## Worked examples

### Worked example: How many moles of N is deposited on NYC due to pigeon poop every year?

Notes:
* Stop at each step to get student input
* Give teams 5 minutes to find the unknown quantities

$$
\frac{\textrm{...pigeons}}{1\textrm{ NYC}} \,
\frac{\textrm{poop events}}{\textrm{pigeon} \times \textrm{day}} \,
\frac{\textrm{...ml poop}}{\textrm{1 poop event}} \,
\frac{1 \textrm{l poop}}{1000 \textrm{ml poop}} \,
\frac{1 \times 10^6 \, \mu \textrm{g N}}{1 \textrm{g N}} \,
\frac{1 \textrm{mol N}}{14 \textrm{g N}} \,
\frac{356.35 \textrm{day}}{1 \textrm{year}}
$$

### In class question: If everyone on earth were to stand in line at the equator and hold hands with arms outstretched, how many times would they wrap around the Earth?
